# FinalProjectFis (MEAN STACK [Mongo,Express,Angular,Node])

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.19.

## Instalations

 Install node.js and angular CLI globally in your corresponding operating system. Use Visual Studio Code installing "Angular Snippets" and "Material Icon Theme" for better experience.
 
## Installing node_modules in local project

 Issue the command `npm update` in the project directory to install the node_modules on which the project depends on.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` to start front end dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. On the other hand, install nodemon globally in node using the command  `npm install -g nodemon` to be able to run the backend server and reload if you change any of its source files, then in another terminal different from the one running the front end dev server, run `npm run backend:start` to start backend server. Note: If there is any package not installed while issuing the server starting commands, despite `npm update` was issued before, try installing every package one by one with npm install --save nameOfPackage.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component in Angular. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
